# Hi!

This repo is for employers looking for code examples of my work. I've pulled code from a variety of projects to provide you with a concrete example of my code quality and organization.

## Tips
A few notes...
* If you'd like to see a good example of my **TypeScript** skills please see the **Firestore Manager** project. There you will see a heavy use of TypeScript Generics, Type Inference, and Function Declaration Overloading.
* If you'd like to see a good example of **frontend-heavy features** (client-side fetching, caching with React Query, and _), see the **SpellTrader** sample.
* If you'd like to see an example of my ability to write **clean, organized, frontend code** that achieves 90+ Lighthouse metrics, see the **Security USA** project sample.
