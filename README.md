# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I'm Ali. I'm a software engineer with experience in a variety of areas in the tech industry. Over the past 15 years, I've worked on VR games, low-level assembly programing, machine learning, data vision, mobile apps, UX design, dev-ops, system design, and web development... among other things. I've also had the opportunity to work in all types of work environments: from "Big Tech" companies (Amazon) to mid-tier companies (Booz Allen Hamilton) to small pre-seed startups. These experiences have helped me become a well-rounded engineer who can handle any unexpected obstacle that shows up - because they always do.

## ðŸ’¼ Employers 
If you're looking for code examples of my work, I've pulled together some samples for you to get an idea of my code quality and organization skills.

### ðŸ’¡ A Few Highlights...
* If you'd like to see a good example of my **TypeScript** skills please see the [Firestore Manager project](https://github.com/AliEskandari/firestore-manager/tree/main/src/functions). There you will see a heavy use of TypeScript Generics, Type Contraints, and Function Declaration Overloading.
* If you'd like to see a good example of **frontend-heavy features** ([client-side fetching through custom hooks](spell-trader/modules/frontend/hooks), [caching with React Query](spell-trader/modules/frontend/hooks), [global state with Zustand](/spell-trader/state.ts)), see the **SpellTrader** sample.
* If you'd like to see an example of my ability to write **clean, organized, frontend code** that achieves 90+ Lighthouse metrics, see the [Security USA](https://github.com/AliEskandari/for-employers/tree/main/security-usa) project sample.
* Lastly, if you'd like to see some **basic testing** using `Storybook.js`, see the [storybook](https://660ce1807fe47f2a1f89d6f5-meomjgpifs.chromatic.com) for the Security USA project.
<!--
* For a good example of my **modular approach to large projects**, see the the [Lockr](https://github.com/AliEskandari/lockr) project repo - specifically for the folder structure and modularization in `modules` folder.
